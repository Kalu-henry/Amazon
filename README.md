# Amazon
An amazon website built with HTML, Vanilla CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

This project was inspired by Simon Bao of SuperSimpleDev.com coding and learning platform.
I would strongly advise anyone that wishes to improve his/her skills in web development to watch his videos on youtube and duly subscribe.

This is an amazon project built with Vanilla Javascript.

It constitutes of different products with their prices and other info attached to it.

When you click the add to cart button the product is added to the cart, where the total of all the products you added to the cart is displayed.

After you have added the products to the cart and chosen the delivery options for each product, you will click on the place order button, which will direct you to the Returns and Orders page,
where you can track your products.

Do well to let me know what you think and where improvements need to be made.

Thank you,
Henry.
